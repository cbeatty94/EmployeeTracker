# EmployeeTracker

As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

In order to achieve this, I have built a command-line application that allows the user to:

Add departments, roles, employees

View departments, roles, employees

Update employee roles;


# Install

npm i - to install all file in order for npm to work
npm i inquirer - to use inquirer (to interact with the user via command line)
npm init - to create a json file
npm i mysql - to connect to MySql database
npm console.table - to format tables
